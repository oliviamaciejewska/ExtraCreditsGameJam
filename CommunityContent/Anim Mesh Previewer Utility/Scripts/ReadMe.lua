Map Instructions:

This template is set up to demonstrate the basic features of the Animated Meshes in Core.  More 
animated mesh varieties are available in Core Content.  In order to see the other Animated Meshes using this 
template, (or to create more variants with different materials etc):

	 - Drag in new Animated Meshes from Core Content. (Renaming the meshes in the hierarchy can 
	   break the animation controls functionality.)
	 
	 - Place them under the group called "Drag Animated Meshes Under Me."
	 
	 - Modify their properties and/or materials.
	 
	 - Enter preview mode and enjoy!

There are additonal options for disabling various UI elements on the group called "OptionsForOnscreenDisplayElements."


Notes about Animated Meshes:
	
	- If an Animated Mesh is selected in the Core Content window, you will be able to see what animation 
	  strings, socket names, and event strings are available for that object.
	  
	- Animated Meshes can be scaled!  (Zero scale and negative scale may give odd results)

	- Animated Meshes support material channels.  Drag materials on their material properties to see what
	  combinations look cool!

	- Animated Meshes need to be under a Client Context to work properly.
